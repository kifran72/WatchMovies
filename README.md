Dev Full Stack : Technical Test

This technical test is designed to assess the three important aspects in working at Petty Well :
Demonstrating expertise 🧑‍💻 🛠️
Stepping out of your comfort zone and starting from scratch 🤯🤯
Conception and architecture: a smart conception and design is more important than tech and tools 📝

To assess these three points, we propose one test:
Realize a proof of concept (POC) in one of your favorite fields

Creation of a web platform like a movie library:
Using the free API of The movie Database, create a front web app allowing to browse movies, with a view by poster.

This platform should be protected by an authentification/inscription form. This form should communicate with an API in your backend. Each endpoints of this API have to be tested by Unittest.
Use the language, frameworks and tools of your choice, for the frontend and the backend.
Other features of your choice can be added.
Bonus question: Write a small deployment bash script.

Any questions ? Just ask :)

At Petty Well, transparency is key! So when we are debriefing together about the tests, don't forget to tell us how you proceeded and worked, what were the main difficulties on each step ;)
